INSTRUCTION HOW TO ASSESS TECHNOLOGY: The building technology can be classified as TRADITIONAL, IMPROVED, MONOLITHIC or PREFABRICATED:
- TRADITIONAL building technology refers to brick construction built up to 1960, typically limited to 6 storeys, and primarily comprising tenement houses (kamienica) and outbuildings.
- IMPROVED building technology involves construction using brick, silicate, and blocks, with a construction year after 1990.
- MONOLITHIC building technology pertains to tall buildings over 15 storeys, built since 2007.
- PREFABRICATED buildings were constructed using panel construction, large slabs (Wielka PÅ‚yta), or concrete, between 1960 and 1995. These can be high blocks with 10 to 12 storeys or low blocks up to 6 storeys. Sometimes real estate agents say that material of these buildings is 'mixed'.

SUMMARY: Provide a brief overview of the building's technology, including its year of construction, type, and number of floors. Disregard details regarding apartment adaptations of the attic.
